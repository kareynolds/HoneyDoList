# HoneyDoList
I initially made this, a rather simple To - Do list, as part of a project in an instrucitonal course. I then tore it down, took the pieces I liked, added some functionality to make it a bit more interested and wound up using it for the crap i've gotta get done on the weekend. Usually handed off to me by my girlfriend.
